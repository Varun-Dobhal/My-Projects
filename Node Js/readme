This is my Project related to Back End.
Here in this i am using Node js with express framework and mongoDb for database management.
Allthough i am using MongoDB but you can use any database you want.
This project is not compelety mine I have worked on it with many changes specially in backend some how my front end is not integreted compeletly showing errors dont know why but if you are watching u can take refrence and can solve the errors.
Well this is just an starting point for me to learn and improve.
